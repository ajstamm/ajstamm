I'm Abigail Stamm, (@ajstamm), a researcher with the Minnesota Department of Health. I am developing my skills in R package creation, documentation, and GIS both for myself and for work. At work, I am active in the R user group (@tidy-mn) and run R programming workshops. In my free time, I enjoy writing and playing games, crafting, and graphic design.

My hobbies include art, poetry, creative writing, and computer programming.
