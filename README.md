I'm Abigail Stamm, (@ajstamm), a researcher with the Minnesota Department of Health. I am developing my skills in R package creation, documentation, and GIS for both my job and my research. In the past, I have run R programming workshops, which I hope to continue. In my free time, I enjoy writing and playing games, crafting, and graphic design.

My hobbies include art, creative writing, and computer programming. 

* Download the [Geographic Aggregation Tool](https://github.com/ajstamm/gatpkg), [Geomasking Tool](https://github.com/ajstamm/geomask), or [Community Design Indicator Processing Package](https://github.com/ajstamm/cdccommdes), three R packages developed for CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking (note: as I am no longer with EPHT, consider these archival versions)
* Check out my [R titanic workshops](https://ajstamm.github.io/titanic) (with the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Community of Practice, New York State Department of Health) and the [R penguins workshops](https://github.com/tidy-MN/R-camp-penguins) (with [tidy-MN](https://github.com/tidy-MN), Minnesota Department of Health)
* Try my games for the [Blinks game system](https://github.com/ajstamm/blinks_public) or on [Itch](https://ajstamm.itch.io)
* Visit my [Art gallery](https://anabiyeni.deviantart.com) or [draw a pumpkin in R](https://github.com/ajstamm/carvedpumpkin)
