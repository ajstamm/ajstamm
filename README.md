I'm Abigail Stamm, (@ajstamm), a researcher with the New York State Department of Health. I am a doctoral student in epidemiology studying the association between air pollution and birth defects at the State University on New York at Albany. I am currently developing my skills in R package creation, documentation, and GIS for both my job and my dissertation. In the past, I have run R programming workshops, which I hope to continue. In my free time, I enjoy writing and playing games, crafting, and graphic design.

My hobbies include art, creative writing, and computer programming. 
* Download the [Geographic Aggregation Tool](https://github.com/ajstamm/gatpkg), an R package
