I'm Abigail Stamm, (@ajstamm), a researcher with the New York State Department of Health. I am a doctoral student in epidemiology studying the association between air pollution and birth defects at the State University on New York at Albany. I am currently developing my skills in R package creation, documentation, and GIS for both my job and my dissertation. In the past, I have run R programming workshops, which I hope to continue. In my free time, I enjoy writing and playing games, crafting, and graphic design.

My hobbies include art, creative writing, and computer programming. 
* Download the [Geographic Aggregation Tool](https://github.com/ajstamm/gatpkg) or the [Community Design Indicator Processing Package](https://github.com/ajstamm/cdccommdes), two R packages developed for CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking (note: as I am no longer with EPHT, consider these archival versions)
* Check out my [R programming workshops](https://ajstamm.github.io/titanic)
* Try my games for the [Blinks game system](https://github.com/ajstamm/blinks_public) or on [Itch](https://ajstamm.itch.io)
* Visit my [Art gallery](https://anabiyeni.deviantart.com) or [draw a pumpkin in R](https://github.com/ajstamm/carvedpumpkin)
