I'm Abigail Stamm, (@ajstamm), a researcher with the New York State Department of Health. I am working on my PhD dissertation on the association between air pollution and birth defects at the State University on New York at Albany. I am currently developing my skills in R package creation, documentation, and GIS for both my job and my dissertation. In the past, I have run R programming workshops, which I hope to continue in the future.

My hobbies include art, creative writing, and computer programming.
